## Public Scripts 

**Internal Use – Test Purposes**

---

### Overview

In this repo I upload my scripts which I write while trying to learn PowerShell, and which I think others can use as well. They will not always be perfect but that doesn't matter. Anyone who wants to test them is welcome to do so.

### Contents

* **Mailing Scripts:** Various scripts that make certain tasks related to mailing easier
* **Checker Scripts:** In the future I want to be able to automatically check various things
* **Other:** The rest is not quite clear yet :D

## Notes

* These scripts are not perfect and can (and will) contain errors and unnecessary things
